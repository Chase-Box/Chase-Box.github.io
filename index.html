        <h2 class="heading">My Goals/Plans:</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>I plan on getting my bachelors degree in computer science.</li>
          <li>I want to develop applications, build programs, and create online items using code.</li>
          <li>I will have to some more difficult math classes, which I fear will be the ultimate difficulties of my goals.</li>
          <li>I want to gain "fluency" in several coding languages so I can better and more quickly develop programs.</li>
          <li>Overall, I plan on pursuing using code to develop and getting better and used to such so I can help out and start my own independent projects.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="heading">Why?</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Coding is something I find interesting, fun, and different.</li>
            <li>Web Development has shown me that code can be used in other ways, regarding more UI based implementations.</li>
            <li>I always wanted to have my main job in the future be development using code. I also always wanted to develop my own seperate programs and applications.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="container2">
        <h2 class="heading2">Where I am now:</h2>
        <ul class="lis2t">
          <li>After this semester, I plan on only having two more years until I'm fully graduated from college.</li>
          <li>After this semester as well, I will be graduating from OTC.</li>
          <li>I'm at a current point that I can consistanly make basic programs in Java, C++, and C#.</li>

            <h2 class="column-heading">Several Websites Like This One</h2>
            <p>Many of my websites are the best or most professionally designed, but I've learned to navigate and use HTML, CSS, and a small amount of Javascript.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h2 class="column-heading">A School Population Simulation Database (In Java)</h2>
            <p>This was a project earlier into my Java class. It mainly dealt with establishing variables, generating new variables, and then storing them. It got to a point that there were enough variables all stored in a single place which was supposed to simulate people.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h2 class="column-heading">A Mini RPG Game Battle Simulation (In Java)</h2>
            <p>I made this as a project to try to challenge myself. It was a mini game where you pick between four characters, each with their own unique skills and powers, and then you fight five enemies in a sequence of waves. Each of the enemies would increase in difficulty as the game progressed. I managed to implement luck-based mechanics into the battles, therefore each and every character could win.</p>
